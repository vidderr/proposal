# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Clash Mayhem

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The user will have certain troops to place where they want on a battle field. Those troops will go against troops placed randomly on the other side of the battle field.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Basically, i plan to have the software give the user option of characters he can choose, they will then be able to choose where on the battlefield they want to place them, basically putting troops into a formation. Once they start the match troops on the opposite side of the battlefield will spawn in at random spots, all at the same time, usually more than the amount that the user has to make it difficult and make their formation more imortant for winning. I plan to use the random import and turtles for the troops to move around along with their attacks. I will use pygame for the visuals of this as well. It will most likely be top down view.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I do not plan on this.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I do not plan on this.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to make sure I accomplis the movement of the characters along with their attacks, health and being damaged. I want to get as many different characters as I can but that may prove to be too challenging.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can get most of the game figured out with one exception being I might not have enough time to make the graphics look amazing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can get all the characters I want in along with have the physics of their movement and attacks look smooth and have the game be exciting and fast paced.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I am definitly going to need more turtle skills for the movement or even a whole new skill set for the movement. I am going to research a lot on how to have attacks look smooth and interact with the characters. Most importantly I want to make sure the game runs smoothly and is fun for the user.
